    "desc": "If you grew up in the 80s, chances are you watched The A-Team at some point. The former Army Special Forces team of Hannibal, B.A. Baracus, Faceman, and Howlin\u2019 Mad spent their time fighting crime and trying to clear their names of a crime they didn\u2019t commit, all the while on the run from military prison. But there was a fifth team member who was a constant presence throughout the show\u2019s run from 1983-1986, but who is less talked about by fans. We\u2019re talking, of course, about B.A.\u2019s black 1983 GMC Vandura van that served as the A-Team\u2019s main mode of transportation.\n\nThis van wasn\u2019t exactly the type of vehicle you should drive if you\u2019re trying to blend in. B.A.\u2019s unique Vandura sported a red stripe across the hood and side panels, black and red wheels, and a red rear spoiler. While vans aren\u2019t often recognised as iconic (with the exception of the Mystery Machine), the A-Team\u2019s Vandura is now as recognisable to 80s kids as KITT or the DeLorean.\n\n-- Mod by Soharic.
